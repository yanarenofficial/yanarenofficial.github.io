His native language is English, and he is also a self-taught speaker and writer of Japanese, achieving <strong>JLPT N1 certification at age nineteen</strong>. Yanazaki discovered his passion for fiction in 2024, producing two original Japanese short stories that same year (<em>A Boy Named X</em> and <em>Stanley</em>). He has since expanded into English fiction and is currently working on the sci-fi short story series <strong>Alisa 2084</strong>, as well as the first volume of the light novel series <em>My Roommate Killed Me and Himself, and Now We Have to Save the World Together!?</em>
