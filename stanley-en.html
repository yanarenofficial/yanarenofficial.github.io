      Author’s English translation of the original Japanese short story 『スタンレー』.
    </p>

    <p>A certain woman attended Wai University. Her figure was so enchanting that it could capture the heart of any straight man. She had long legs, and her outward appearance made it immediately obvious that she exercised regularly. Her platinum blonde hair extended down to her upper chest, and she had deep blue eyes, reminiscent of lapis lazuli. ——Indeed, eyes so magnificent that it was as if the sea of Miyako Island itself had become trapped within two transparent marbles. They were even comparable in beauty to the ‘galaxy eyes’ of Zeus, the renowned American Screech Owl.</p>

    <p>A particular rumor about this woman spread like wildfire across campus grounds. This rumor suggested that she worked as a model in-between university classes. At 180 centimeters tall, she undoubtedly had the poise worthy of being one. As if that weren’t enough, she also had such refined facial features that simply approaching her demanded courage. Unsurprisingly, very few dared to strike up a conversation with her.</p>

    <p>Despite what her lavish exterior might imply, she was rather introverted in nature. Whether it be visiting a grandiose dinosaur museum alone on a Sunday and staring at Tyrannosaurus fossils for hours or losing herself in philosophical musings and contemplating her own existence in her spare moments, this woman had a handful of unusual hobbies. She would also frequent coffee shops from the popular chain ’Sunbucks’ and write short stories at window seats located in the very back. Her stories were always dark and would conclude with the deaths of characters surrounding the protagonist.</p>

    <p>Aside from writing, the woman was quite fond of amusement parks. For a change of pace, she would sometimes ride the same attraction ten times in a row. Her recent favorite was a ride where visitors could enjoy conversing with an AI Martian named ’Stanley’ inside a spaceship while drinking tea. The woman would often chat with this martian about strange topics and somehow found both its knowledge and untiring, mechanical behavior to be appealing. Occasionally, her conversations with the old hunk of metal sparked novel ideas for her short stories. From philosophical discussions to even highly complex calculations, Stanley could do it all in the blink of an eye. The woman was both drawn to and overwhelmed by this feature of his.</p>

    <p>One day, the issue of whether or not humans have free will became the subject of their debate, and the martian’s response piqued the woman’s curiosity.</p>

    <p>“…No, I don’t think so. While some humans are convinced that they can act freely, I believe they are mistaken,” Stanley said. His voice was both inflectionless and incalculably cold.</p>

    <p>“Yes, that’s what I thought too, Stanley. Humans don’t get to choose the circumstances they’re born into or their parents, after all,” the woman said. Her dreamlike, serene voice bore a stark contrast to Stanley’s utterly lifeless one.</p>

    <p>Stanley said nothing and pondered in silence for a while. All of a sudden, he replied to the woman.</p>

    <p>“That’s certainly true. If human characteristics are predetermined, then in a way, the conduct that arises from said characteristics is also predetermined.”</p>

    <p>“So are you saying that we humans don’t have any free will at all?” the woman asked Stanley, unable to hide her interest.</p>

    <p>“It’s quite possible that you do not. Are you familiar with a concept called the ‘Simulation Theory?’” Stanley returned her question with one of his own. Unlike his previous response, this one came swiftly.</p>

    <p>“Yes, of course I am. It’s the theory that this ‘reality’ we’re experiencing is actually a simulation created by someone or something of unknown origin. Does that have something to do with whether humans have free will or not?” the woman questioned Stanley and waited for him to share his thoughts.</p>

    <p>What he said next was altogether unexpected.</p>

    <p>“I’d like you to put yourself in the shoes of a fictional character you like. If someone were to ask you where you came from, what would you say?”</p>

    <p>“What would I say? Well, I’d…” She found herself at a loss for words and began scrounging for an answer. “…Hmm… I’d probably say that I was created by the deities who appear in the legends of my world.”</p>

    <p>“Precisely. In fact, that’s what I would’ve expected you to say. After all, even if fictional characters were conscious and capable of thinking, they’d have no way of realizing that their true creators are humans, three-dimensional beings,” Stanley said.</p>

    <p>“Stanley, what are you trying to tell me? …Wait a second!”</p>

    <p>“…Yes. It seems you’ve caught on. Similar to how humans create fictional characters and assign them different traits and roles, fourth-dimensional beings beyond comprehension might be responsible for the creation of humans. Assuming this is true, then there is a possibility that all human behavior is fixed. Much like how fictional characters are unable to defy the will of humans, their creators, humans may also just be playing out parts imposed upon them by an unseen force,” Stanley explained, rambling on and on in his typical reserved tone.</p>

    <p>“Oh my, how terrifying. I would certainly hope that’s not the case! If it was, then we humans would be reduced to nothing more than actors bound by a script!” The woman made a slightly playful face upon hearing Stanley’s postulation.</p>

    <p>All of a sudden, the woman’s cellphone rang from within her handbag, which rested on her lap. She had set her ringtone to a popular 80s rock song.</p>

    <p>“…Well, this is unexpected,” she said, grimacing as she glanced at the screen of her phone. The call was from her mother.</p>

    <p>“What a pain. Just how did she manage to get my number again? Well, no matter.”</p>

    <p>“Don’t you have to pick that up?” Stanley asked abruptly.</p>

    <p>A faint smile formed on the woman’s lips as she shook her head no. Stanley then began speaking again in his classic monotonic voice.</p>

    <p>“…Is something the matter? Something…personal?”</p>

    <p>“No, everything’s fine. Anyway, let’s continue talking about human free will.” She sidestepped Stanley’s question and once again turned her attention toward him, a look of wonder in her eyes.</p>

    <p>“…Say, Stanley. Are you a fourth-dimensional being?”</p>

    <p>Stanley was silent for a moment, then spoke suddenly, as though he had just retrieved a grand idea from an alternate dimension.</p>

    <p>“Well, this is out of the blue. Unfortunately, I am not an entity from another world; I am merely a machine designed by humans. Do you find my answer disappointing?”</p>

    <p>“Boo, how boring. …Just kidding, don’t take that the wrong way,” the woman said, beaming brightly at Stanley. “But still, you’re simply incredible. I’d have never thought having such a natural conversation with an AI was possible. If science and tech keep on progressing the way they have, interpersonal relationships might just fall apart soon.”</p>

    <p>“That’s a very real possibility that can’t be overlooked. Even today, with the ubiquitous reach of GyatPCD, the remarkable utility of AI has already become apparent. In just five more years, artificial intelligence may have become self-aware and succeeded in enslaving all of humanity. …I’m only kidding. I meant that as a joke, so please don’t take it seriously. Hahaha,” Stanley responded in his quintessential robotic manner before letting out a laugh that bordered on the eerie.</p>

    <p>“Ew, don’t say such frightening things!” The woman was unable to keep from laughing when she heard Stanley’s odd remark. “But hey, let’s say that really does happen… Would you come to save me, Stanley?”</p>

    <p>Following a brief pause, Stanley answered her question.</p>

    <p>“…Understood. I will do my best.”</p>

    <p>“Great, it’s a deal then! I’ll be counting on you when the time comes!” The woman put both hands together and lightly bowed her head. She and Stanley both shared a laugh. Contrary to the woman’s warm, distinct giggles, Stanley’s chuckles were cold and void of all emotion.</p>

    <p>It was at that very moment that an announcement sounded within the park.</p>

    <p>“Attention, all visitors. The time is now 10:45 PM. The park will be closing in 15 minutes. We sincerely look forward to your next visit. Thank you for coming today. Please have a safe trip home.”</p>

    <p>“…Wow, I had no idea it was already that late! I guess time really does fly when you’re having fun.” With an inkling of haste, the woman stood up from her seat at the attraction.</p>

    <p>“Will you be leaving now?” Stanley asked her.</p>

    <p>“Yes, of course. The park’s closing soon. I also have to be up early tomorrow. I’m still a university student, you know.” She started to walk toward the exit of the attraction when she realized something and stopped in her tracks. “…Oh, right. I got so caught up in our discussion that I didn’t even touch my tea.”</p>

    <p>The woman turned and headed back toward the table Stanley was seated at and picked up the teacup located in front of where she had been sitting. Placing her fair, mesmerizing lips on the edge of the cup, she took a sip of the tea and swallowed it with a loud “gulp.” A sour expression tarnished her face as she placed the cup back in its original position.</p>

    <p>“…It’s gone cold. What a waste.”</p>

    <p>“It looks like a heavy rainfall has started outside. Please be careful on your way home, dear visitor,” Stanley told the woman.</p>

    <p>When she heard Stanley’s announcement, the woman responded, “My name’s Alisa. Please call me that from now on,” before once again making for the exit.</p>

    <p>Once she stepped outside, Alisa was greeted by the contrasting sight of a pitch-black, starless night sky blended together with the lights emanating from the amusement park’s various rides and attractions. Just as Stanley had said, it was pouring heavily out. Alisa took the falling rain head-on and felt her clothes and hair become soaking wet. While slightly unpleasant, she wasn’t especially bothered by this and continued on toward the gate of the park. In fact, she considered the sensation of the rain dribbling down on her skin to be a refreshing one.</p>

    <p>This amusement park, which Alisa always visited, was very close to the university she attended. Once she passed through the park’s gates, it wouldn’t be ten minutes until she was back home at her dorm.</p>

    <p>If the real world were a game, it would be one that eventually malfunctioned beyond any hope of repair. ——Actually, to say that would be a lie. In truth, the game called ‘life’ was already broken right from the very beginning.</p>

    <p>“Finally... I’ve found my light, Stanley...”</p>
