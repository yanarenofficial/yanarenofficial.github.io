      Author’s English translation of the original Japanese short story 『スタンレー』.
    </p>

    <p>A certain woman attended Wai University. Her figure was so enchanting that it could capture the heart of any straight man. She had long legs, and her outward appearance made it immediately obvious that she exercised regularly. Her platinum blonde hair extended down to her upper chest, and she had deep blue eyes, reminiscent of lapis lazuli. ——Indeed, eyes so magnificent that it was as if the sea of Miyako Island itself had become trapped within two transparent marbles. They were even comparable in beauty to the ‘galaxy eyes’ of Zeus, the renowned American Screech Owl.</p>

<p>A particular rumor about this woman spread like wildfire across campus grounds. This rumor suggested that she worked as a model in-between university classes. At 180 centimeters tall, she undoubtedly had the poise worthy of being one. As if that weren’t enough, she also had such refined facial features that simply approaching her demanded courage. Unsurprisingly, very few dared to strike up a conversation with her.</p>

<p>Despite what her lavish exterior might imply, she was rather introverted in nature. Whether it be visiting a grandiose dinosaur museum alone on a Sunday and staring at Tyrannosaurus fossils for hours or losing herself in philosophical musings and contemplating her own existence in her spare moments, this woman had a handful of unusual hobbies. She would also frequent coffee shops from the popular chain ’Sunbucks’ and write short stories at window seats located in the very back. Her stories were always dark and would conclude with the deaths of characters surrounding the protagonist.</p>

<p>Aside from writing, the woman was quite fond of amusement parks. For a change of pace, she would sometimes ride the same attraction ten times in a row. Her recent favorite was a ride where visitors could enjoy conversing with an AI Martian named ’Stanley’ inside a spaceship while drinking tea. The woman would often chat with this martian about strange topics and somehow found both its knowledge and untiring, mechanical behavior to be appealing. Occasionally, her conversations with the old hunk of metal sparked novel ideas for her short stories. From philosophical discussions to even highly complex calculations, Stanley could do it all in the blink of an eye. The woman was both drawn to and overwhelmed by this feature of his.</p>

<p>One day, the issue of whether or not humans have free will became the subject of their debate, and the martian’s response piqued the woman’s curiosity.</p>

<p>“…No, I don’t think so. While some humans are convinced that they can act freely, I believe they are mistaken,” Stanley said. His voice was both inflectionless and incalculably cold.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what I thought too, Stanley. Humans don’t get to choose the circumstances they’re born into or their parents, after all,” the woman said. Her dreamlike, serene voice bore a stark contrast to Stanley’s utterly lifeless one.</p>

<p>Stanley said nothing and pondered in silence for a while. All of a sudden, he replied to the woman.</p>

<p>“That’s certainly true. If human characteristics are predetermined, then in a way, the conduct that arises from said characteristics is also predetermined.”</p>

<p>“So are you saying that we humans don’t have any free will at all?” the woman asked Stanley, unable to hide her interest.</p>

<p>“It’s quite possible that you do not. Are you familiar with a concept called the ‘Simulation Theory?’” Stanley returned her question with one of his own. Unlike his previous response, this one came swiftly.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course I am. It’s the theory that this ‘reality’ we’re experiencing is actually a simulation created by someone or something of unknown origin. Does that have something to do with whether humans have free will or not?” the woman questioned Stanley and waited for him to share his thoughts.</p>

<p>What he said next was altogether unexpected.</p>

<p>“I’d like you to put yourself in the shoes of a fictional character you like. If someone were to ask you where you came from, what would you say?”</p>

<p>“What would I say? Well, I’d…” She found herself at a loss for words and began scrounging for an answer. “…Hmm… I’d probably say that I was created by the deities who appear in the legends of my world.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. In fact, that’s what I would’ve expected you to say. After all, even if fictional characters were conscious and capable of thinking, they’d have no way of realizing that their true creators are humans, three-dimensional beings,” Stanley said.</p>

<p>“Stanley, what are you trying to tell me? …Wait a second!”</p>

<p>“…Yes. It seems you’ve caught on. Similar to how humans create fictional characters and assign them different traits and roles, fourth-dimensional beings beyond comprehension might be responsible for the creation of humans. Assuming this is true, then there is a possibility that all human behavior is fixed. Much like how fictional characters are unable to defy the will of humans, their creators, humans may also just be playing out parts imposed upon them by an unseen force,” Stanley explained, rambling on and on in his typical reserved tone.</p>

<p>“Oh my, how terrifying. I would certainly hope that’s not the case! If it was, then we humans would be reduced to nothing more than actors bound by a script!” The woman made a slightly playful face upon hearing Stanley’s postulation.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, the woman’s cellphone rang from within her handbag, which rested on her lap. She had set her ringtone to a popular 80s rock song.</p>

<p>“…Well, this is unexpected,” she said, grimacing as she glanced at the screen of her phone. The call was from her mother.</p>

<p>“What a pain. Just how did she manage to get my number again? Well, no matter.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you have to pick that up?” Stanley asked abruptly.</p>

<p>A faint smile formed on the woman’s lips as she shook her head no. Stanley then began speaking again in his classic monotonic voice.</p>

<p>“…Is something the matter? Something…personal?”</p>

<p>“No, everything’s fine. Anyway, let’s continue talking about human free will.” She sidestepped Stanley’s question and once again turned her attention toward him, a look of wonder in her eyes.</p>

<p>“…Say, Stanley. Are you a fourth-dimensional being?”</p>

<p>Stanley was silent for a moment, then spoke suddenly, as though he had just retrieved a grand idea from an alternate dimension.</p>

<p>“Well, this is out of the blue. Unfortunately, I am not an entity from another world; I am merely a machine designed by humans. Do you find my answer disappointing?”</p>

<p>“Boo, how boring. …Just kidding, don’t take that the wrong way,” the woman said, beaming brightly at Stanley. “But still, you’re simply incredible. I’d have never thought having such a natural conversation with an AI was possible. If science and tech keep on progressing the way they have, interpersonal relationships might just fall apart soon.”</p>

<p>“That’s a very real possibility that can’t be overlooked. Even today, with the ubiquitous reach of GyatPCD, the remarkable utility of AI has already become apparent. In just five more years, artificial intelligence may have become self-aware and succeeded in enslaving all of humanity. …I’m only kidding. I meant that as a joke, so please don’t take it seriously. Hahaha,” Stanley responded in his quintessential robotic manner before letting out a laugh that bordered on the eerie.</p>

<p>“Ew, don’t say such frightening things!” The woman was unable to keep from laughing when she heard Stanley’s odd remark. “But hey, let’s say that really does happen… Would you come to save me, Stanley?”</p>

<p>Following a brief pause, Stanley answered her question.</p>

<p>“…Understood. I will do my best.”</p>

<p>“Great, it’s a deal then! I’ll be counting on you when the time comes!” The woman put both hands together and lightly bowed her head. She and Stanley both shared a laugh. Contrary to the woman’s warm, distinct giggles, Stanley’s chuckles were cold and void of all emotion.</p>

<p>It was at that very moment that an announcement sounded within the park.</p>

<p>“Attention, all visitors. The time is now 10:45 PM. The park will be closing in 15 minutes. We sincerely look forward to your next visit. Thank you for coming today. Please have a safe trip home.”</p>

<p>“…Wow, I had no idea it was already that late! I guess time really does fly when you’re having fun.” With an inkling of haste, the woman stood up from her seat at the attraction.</p>

<p>“Will you be leaving now?” Stanley asked her.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. The park’s closing soon. I also have to be up early tomorrow. I’m still a university student, you know.” She started to walk toward the exit of the attraction when she realized something and stopped in her tracks. “…Oh, right. I got so caught up in our discussion that I didn’t even touch my tea.”</p>

<p>The woman turned and headed back toward the table Stanley was seated at and picked up the teacup located in front of where she had been sitting. Placing her fair, mesmerizing lips on the edge of the cup, she took a sip of the tea and swallowed it with a loud “gulp.” A sour expression tarnished her face as she placed the cup back in its original position.</p>

<p>“…It’s gone cold. What a waste.”</p>

<p>“It looks like a heavy rainfall has started outside. Please be careful on your way home, dear visitor,” Stanley told the woman. He was right; a light pattering sound of water and metal colliding with one another could be heard from the attraction’s exterior.</p>

<p>When she heard Stanley’s announcement, the woman responded, “My name’s Alisa. Please call me that from now on,” before once again making for the exit.</p>

<p>Once she stepped outside, Alisa was greeted by the contrasting sight of a pitch-black, starless night sky blended together with the lights emanating from the amusement park’s various rides and attractions. Just as Stanley had said, it was pouring heavily out. Alisa took the falling rain head-on and felt her clothes and hair become soaking wet. While slightly unpleasant, she wasn’t especially bothered by this and continued on toward the gate of the park. In fact, she considered the sensation of the rain dribbling down on her skin to be a refreshing one.</p>

<p>This amusement park, which Alisa always visited, was very close to the university she attended. Once she passed through the park’s gates, it wouldn’t be ten minutes until she was back home at her dorm. She left the park and ventured down the return path to her university for a while when a pleasant smell tickled her nostrils. It was the smell of fresh petrichor. That scent, which drifted through the night air, was all-too-effective in calming Alisa’s nerves.</p>

<p>Be it the towering buildings surrounding her, the dim glow of the streetlights that lined the sidewalk she was strolling down, or the feeling of her entire body being struck and dampened by the harsh rainstorm, she found it all so wholesome. It was as if she was experiencing the embodiment of an absolute, unencumbered sense of freedom.</p>

<p>Alisa sauntered down the path leading through the city with an unreal gracefulness; her strides were as smooth as the elegant movements of even the most professional ice skaters. The high heels she wore made sharp noises that sliced clean through the air each time they made rhythmic contact with the ground. Click, click, click, click.</p>

<p>Drivers passing by on the street and bystanders in the vicinity found both her staggering figure and blue eyes, which reflected the gleam of the streetlights, to be striking, yet formidable. Yes——it was as if they were witnessing a phantom wandering through an evening downpour.</p>

<p>Many passersby attempted to give Alisa an umbrella on the way back to her dorm, but she politely declined every offer she received. She was simply drawn to the natural world and found rain to be a fascinating occurrence. ——No, it wasn’t just rain that Alisa found fascinating, but all of reality itself. She suddenly recalled the words her mother had said to her as a child.</p>

<p>“Within this supposedly uneventful world, magic truly does exist. It disguises itself in plain sight as the extraordinarily mundane.”</p>

<p>According to her mother, this was a message left to Alisa by her father. Her father, whose face she had never once seen. It wasn’t that she suffered from face blindness. Her father hadn’t just abandoned her during her youth and went into hiding somewhere, either. Alisa had simply never met her father before in her life. Despite this, she did not particularly harbor ill will toward his absence. Rather, her heart raced with excitement at the thought of who he might be.</p>

<p>Whilst walking leisurely through the stormy night, Alisa noticed a lightning bolt streak across the jet black sky. It was an enormous one shaped like a vein. As soon as she saw it, she braced herself mentally for the impending roar of thunder, inhaling deeply through her nose until her lungs were full. Sure enough, an earsplitting boom was soon upon her. Rumble rumble, rumble rumble. At that instant, Alisa let out a whisper of pure astonishment.</p>

<p>“If this really is all just a simulation, whoever created it sure knows how to put on a show. ...Wouldn’t you say, Stanley?”</p>

<p>The words that escaped her lips became a subtle reverberation and were eventually wholly consumed by the lively sound of the falling rain.</p>

<p>Shortly after, far off in the distance, Alisa was able to vaguely make out something waving back and forth atop a tall building. The object being shaken about by the violent wind was something she was intimately familiar with. It was the large, red flag raised above the roof of the dorm she lived in. Amidst her journey through the vision-impeding rainstorm, that flag served as a beacon that showed Alisa the way back home.</p>

<p>“I have to say, my school really does have a futuristic look to it,” she said, formally marveling at the gargantuan figure of her university’s dorm. The glistening skyscraper easily surpassed 120 meters in height, making it a spectacle that naturally attracted attention. The building itself was made out of pure white marble, and the amber-colored light that surged from the windows of its many rooms displayed a symmetrical grid pattern to onlookers. Alisa personally felt that the evening rainfall managed to amplify the dorm’s beauty rather than diminish it.</p>

<p>The flag coming into view meant that she would reach the dorm in five minutes if she kept her current pace; this is something Alisa knew instinctually. Having taken this route home from the same amusement park so many times, her body had effectively memorized it. ...five minutes. In other words, three hundred seconds. In that amount of time, Alisa was confident that she could easily come up with a prologue for a new short story. Before long, she began to speak in a delightful voice as she kept her eyes fixated on the dorm’s majestic figure, which was slowly growing closer.</p>

<p>“…Now then, let us begin with a story of a close acquaintance of mine. Yes——A story of someone I consider to be of utmost importance and intrigue. Once upon a time, he told me this: ‘Fiction is a safe haven born from the unspeakable horrors of reality.’ At the time, I couldn’t comprehend the profundity of that statement. I just simply couldn’t. ...But things are different now. I have finally come to understand what he meant by that. Doing so was unbelievably challenging; it was like trying to catch an elusive, slippery snake with my hands.”</p>

<p>Without warning, Alisa paused and stood quietly in place, allowing the unyielding storm to wash over her thoroughly.</p>

<p>“Not a bad ring to it. Hmm, now where should we take this next?” she said, gently pinching her chin between the pointer finger and thumb of her left hand.</p>

<p>Alisa briefly entered a state of still contemplation. A cheerful expression that implied she had struck gold then emerged on her face, followed by her softly murmuring, “I got it.” After clearing her throat with a loud “ahem,” she broke into a walk again and resumed her story.</p>

<p>“…No, maybe I just didn’t want to catch that snake. After all, ignorance is the most effective tool in bringing about happiness. Casting everything by the wayside and throwing oneself fully into escapism is a path reserved only for those who, despite giving their all to overcome the bleakness of reality, eventually succumb to despair upon realizing that they cannot. I mean this earnestly when I say I never wanted to give up on true happiness. ...But in the end, I had to. I was left with no other choice.</p>

<p>If the real world were a game, it would be one that eventually malfunctioned beyond any hope of repair. ——Actually, to say that would be a lie. In truth, the game called ‘life’ was already broken right from the very beginning. Authoritarian education systems and ceaseless wars with obscure motives. Talents, or the lack thereof, and even familial environs are randomly assigned to all players, and there are no opportunities to start over from scratch.”</p>

<p>“Yikes, that might’ve been a bit much. I never expected things to get this dark this quickly...” Alisa sighed, visibly bewildered by the power of her own imagination. “...In any case, telling stories sure does pass the time in a heartbeat.”</p>

<p>Without Alisa realizing it, her school’s colossal dorm, which had previously been so far away, now appeared much larger to her in all its spectacular glory. At her current pace, she would arrive at the building’s front entrance in under two minutes. Just two more minutes. In that small amount of time, Alisa was determined to concoct a fitting ending for the prelude of her story.</p>

<p>“...Stay calm. Try and think of a way to wrap this up cleanly. I know I can do it. Coming up with a conclusion for an intro in two minutes should be a piece of cake.” She raised her own spirits with mental words of encouragement and took several deep breaths. As if to say, “Alright, I’ve got it!” she conjured a look of pure confidence upon her slightly face, which was saturated with rain. Then she began to play narrator again. As per usual, her angelic voice had a silky touch to it. This time around, Alisa paid special attention to her enunciation; the passion and vigor behind her delivery suggested she was putting on a grand performance for a large audience.</p>

<p>“...However, that might well be the reason that fiction came into existence. Fiction can be seen as a type of ‘medicine.’ The world is currently overrun by a plethora of illnesses. And to cure illnesses, medicine is required. ——No. Allow me to rephrase that. One might even call it an absolute necessity. ——Reality and fiction. On the surface, they may seem entirely separate, yet between them lies a certain duality. Yes——a duality of Yin and Yang.”</p>

<p>When they created the simulation of life, the great gods of the fourth dimension probably thought something like this.</p>

<p>“......Let us bestow a gift of solace upon the lamentable beings who will soon writhe about in the three-dimensional world. Condemning them to forever wander the darkness without a flashlight would simply be unethical. What point would there be in a game that offers nothing but despair? It is for that reason that we must assign the ‘Human’ variable a practical trait. A trait that allows them to form any image they desire within their own heads. This will serve as both a small bonfire amid the misery of grueling experiences and a trump card that liberates them in times of lostness. Because this ability allows users to form images of their liking, we shall name it ‘Imagination.’ ......Yes, that seems rather suitable. ‘Image’ and ‘imagi.’ Their pronunciations are undeniably similar. We shall grant this ability to all humans as a birthright. By doing so, fiction, which exists on the other side of the three-dimensional reality they will soon endure, will inevitably be born.</p>

<p>——Kakuu, or fiction, is the light of hope that lifts the somberness of reality, even if only just a bit.’”</p>

<p>“The light of hope that lifts the somberness of reality, even if only just a bit......”</p>

<p>Alisa unknowingly found herself repeating those words. Their pale echo aroused a warmth in her chest.</p>

<p>“......Looks like I just barely made it in time.” She let out a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Her soaring dorm, which seemed to stretch into the sky, now stood before her eyes. As always, its glimmering appearance left her astounded. The falling rain took nothing away from the building’s extravagant presence; its glamor even gave the gigantic Christmas tree located in Kyuu York City’s ‘Lucky Fella Center’ a run for its money.</p>

<p>Alisa passed through the university gates and momentarily stood in quietude in front of the staircase that continued to the front entrance of her dorm. She was imbued from head to toe by the honeyed luster that oozed from the building. The ensuing light caused every drop of water on her body to twinkle and vividly illuminated both her deep blue eyes and glossy black dress. Her figure, embraced by an orange-tinted gold, formed an agreeable contrast with the white marble staircase that connected to her dorm.</p>

<p>The rainfall from earlier showed no signs of stopping and only grew more intense. An unforeseen gust of wind swung into the area, and Alisa felt the raindrops it brought with it stimulate her skin. While she didn’t feel pain, the countless specks of water left her with a mild tingling as they delicately pelted her body. She relished the experience, tilting her head toward the sky and slowly closing her eyelids. Rainwater dribbled down her cheek and trickled into her mouth. Only the liquid wasn’t rainwater at all. The unmistakable taste that gradually spanned throughout her mouth was undeniably the bitter and salty flavor exclusive to tears.</p>

<p>Yes——she had unknowingly started to cry. Her manner of doing so was neither one of sniveling nor wailing. Alisa merely faced the murky night sky with her eyes closed as she wept soundlessly. Soon after, she steadily opened her eyes, allowing the dorm’s sublime radiance to flood her vision once more. Alisa then began to ascend the lofty stairwell, almost as though she had decided to on a whim. Predictably, the high heels on her feet made a distinguished clicking noise. Her rear figure climbing up each step, while ever beautiful, told of a discreet sadness. At the nearing sight of her mountainous dorm, Alisa found herself casting a single phrase lovingly into the rain. What arose from her lips was a whisper of unbridled tenderness.</p>

<p>“Finally... I’ve found my light, Stanley...”</p>
