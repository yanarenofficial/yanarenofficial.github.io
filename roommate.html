          <h2>Series Overview</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>My Roommate Killed Me and Himself, and Now We Have to Save the World Together!?</strong>
            is an isekai light-novel-style series that blends dark comedy, apocalyptic fantasy, and volatile
            roommate dynamics. It follows two classmates whose lives end in the worst way possible—murder-suicide—
            only for them to wake up in a different world with a single condition placed on their existence:
            work together, or watch reality collapse.
          </p>

          <p>
            Their deaths are not an ending but a beginning. Thrown into a post-death, otherworldly setting with
            world-saving contracts, strange powers, and incomprehensible overseers, the pair are forced into a
            partnership neither of them wants, under stakes neither of them can afford to ignore.

        <h2>Format &amp; Structure</h2>

        <p>
          The project is being developed as a multi-volume light novel series. The first volume is currently
          in progress and is planned to introduce:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>The circumstances leading up to their deaths in the original world</li>
          <li>The rules and structure of the new isekai environment</li>
          <li>The core “save the world or disappear” contract that binds them</li>
          <li>The early stages of their forced alliance and clashing personalities</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Tone &amp; Themes</h2>

        <p>
          Although the premise starts from a grim event, the series leans heavily into
          <strong>dark humor</strong> and emotionally charged character interactions rather than pure edge.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Comedy emerging from impossible situations and broken people</li>
          <li>Apocalyptic stakes contrasted with petty, human-level resentment</li>
          <li>Surreal isekai mechanics and world-saving contracts</li>
          <li>Identity, guilt, responsibility, and the question of whether either of them deserves a second chance</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Status &amp; Progress</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Current status:</strong> Volume 1 — In progress.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Drafting: early–mid stages</li>
          <li>Planned structure: multi-chapter first volume, followed by additional arcs</li>
          <li>This page will be updated as drafting and revision milestones are reached.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Planned Table of Contents (Volume 1)</h2>

        <p>
          The exact chapter titles and count may change, but Volume 1 is currently planned along lines like:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Chapter 1 — The Night Everything Went Wrong <em>(working title)</em></li>
          <li>Chapter 2 — Afterlife Orientation <em>(working title)</em></li>
          <li>Chapter 3 — Contract for Two Corpses <em>(working title)</em></li>
          <li>Chapter 4+ — Early missions, world rules, and the first cracks in their forced partnership</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          As the manuscript stabilizes, this section will be replaced with the final chapter list and reading order,
          along with links to sample chapters or release editions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Volume 1 is actively being written.</strong> Over time, this page will expand to include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Finalized Volume 1 summary and back-cover style blurb</li>
          <li>Full table of contents and reading order</li>
          <li>Links to excerpts or complete chapters</li>
          <li>Notes on subsequent volumes and arcs once they enter planning</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For now, this page serves as the central hub for the series as it moves through drafting and development.
