      <h1>My Roommate Killed Me and Himself, and Now We Have to Save the World Together!?</h1>

      <p><strong>My Roommate Killed Me and Himself, and Now We Have to Save the World Together!?</strong> is an experimental light-novel-style series that blends dark comedy, apocalyptic fantasy, and emotionally volatile character dynamics.</p>

      <p>The story follows two classmates whose deaths do not mark an ending, but a beginning: forced into a surreal post-death world where saving reality itself becomes their only path forward.</p>

      <h2>Format</h2>

      <p>The project is being developed as a multi-volume light novel series. The first volume is currently in progress.</p>

      <h2>Tone &amp; Focus</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Dark humor layered over emotional trauma</li>
        <li>Apocalyptic stakes with intimate character conflict</li>
        <li>Surreal afterlife mechanics and world-saving contracts</li>
        <li>Identity, guilt, and forced cooperation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Status</h2>

      <p>The first volume is actively being written. This page will later expand with summaries, reading order, and release structure.</p>
