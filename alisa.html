      <!-- Logline / high-level pitch -->
      <div class="featured-project-text">
        <p>
          <strong>Alisa 2084</strong> is an ongoing flash fiction series about a reckless,
          hyper-competent operative who treats time, memory, and parallel realities as
          tools to be bent, hacked, or broken in pursuit of high-risk contracts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each story is a self-contained mission—a pyramid heist gone wrong, a personal
          apocalypse revisited, a deal with something older than the universe—gradually
          sketching out the life of a woman who keeps throwing herself into cosmic chaos
          to outrun the one thing she can’t escape: her own history.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Series Overview -->
    <h2>Series Overview</h2>

    <p>
      The series moves across futures, alternate timelines, and impossible architectures:
      cybernetic cities, alien courts, cursed artifacts, and quiet rooms where time is
      breaking in ways only Alisa can see. Beneath the spectacle, the core is
      psychological—how much of yourself you can trade away before there’s nothing left
      to come back to.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>High-speed, high-stakes missions that can be read in a single sitting</li>
      <li>Time travel, alternate histories, and parallel world hopping</li>
      <li>Dark humor layered over trauma, regret, and obsession</li>
      <li>A gradual reveal of Alisa’s past, her family, and what she’s really running from</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Format & Structure -->
    <h2>Format &amp; Structure</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Alisa 2084</strong> is written as episodic flash fiction. Most entries can be
      read in isolation, but recurring characters, locations, and consequences reward
      reading more of the sequence.
    </p>

    <p>The series includes a mix of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Action-driven heists and disasters</li>
      <li>Quieter, emotionally focused pieces that drill into a single moment</li>
      <li>Stories that bend the rules of perspective, time, or reality itself</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Selected Episodes -->
    <h2>Selected Episodes</h2>

    <p>Alisa’s world is sprawling, but a few missions stand out as core to the series:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>“My Apocalypse”</strong> — Alisa travels back to the night her parents’
        relationship implodes, planning a quiet intervention that spirals into something
        far darker.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>“Khufu and the Feshuaran Root”</strong> — A pyramid dive for a ridiculous,
        half-mythic artifact turns into a running battle through traps, curses, and the
        ego of a long-dead king.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>“Sauroniops Days”</strong> — A dinosaur-era mission where the line between
        hallucination, simulation, and reality erodes with every step.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>“Extreme Watch Heist”</strong> — A time-manipulating device, a city locked
        in overlapping seconds, and a job that goes catastrophically right.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>“Ouroboros”</strong> — A closed-loop operation that forces Alisa to confront
        the version of herself who never escaped.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      New flash pieces continue to expand the timeline, filling in both the strange jobs
      she takes and the emotional fallout she refuses to look at directly.
    </p>

    <!-- Current Status -->
    <h2>Current Status</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Alisa 2084</strong> is an active, long-term project. Stories are released as
      individual flash pieces and may later be curated into one or more themed collections.
    </p>

    <p>Over time, this page will expand to include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A suggested reading order for key arcs</li>
      <li>Story groupings by theme (family, heists, cosmic horror, etc.)</li>
      <li>Notes on the evolving timeline and where each episode fits</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For now, this page serves as the central hub for the series as it continues to grow.
