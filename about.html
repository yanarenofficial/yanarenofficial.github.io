      <h1>About Yanaren</h1>

      <p><strong>Yanaren</strong> is the pen name of Rentarou Yanazaki（柳崎 蓮太郎）, a bilingual fiction writer working in both English and Japanese. This site serves as a personal publishing platform for original stories, experimental series, and long-form narrative projects.</p>

      <p>Rather than focusing on a single genre, Yanaren’s work explores a wide range of tones and structures: science fiction, psychological fiction, dark humor, surrealism, and introspective character-driven stories. Many projects are released as serial or episodic works.</p>

      <p>This site is intentionally minimal. It exists primarily as a quiet studio space for development rather than a polished commercial storefront. Projects are built slowly, refined over time, and released when they are ready.</p>

      <h2>Languages & Approach</h2>

      <p>Yanaren writes in both English and Japanese. The Japanese works hosted here are original literary projects rather than translations. Language itself is treated not only as a tool but as a creative constraint that shapes structure, rhythm, and perspective.</p>

      <h2>Long-Term Vision</h2>

      <p>The long-term goal of this platform is to function as a self-contained creative archive: a place where multiple narrative universes, standalone stories, and experimental projects can coexist without algorithm pressure or platform dependency.</p>

      <p>Nothing here is built for speed. Everything is built for endurance.</p>
